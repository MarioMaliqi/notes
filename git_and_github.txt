Hello World:
  // TODO:

setup git and github: 
  cli tools:
    git = allows you to work with repo locally
    gh (GitHub) = allows you to work with repo hosted remotely on Github

  installation of tools:
    -> $ sudo apt install git
    -> $ sudo apt install gh

  set username and email in git:
    -> $ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
    -> $ git config --global user.email "maliqimario@gmail.com"

  authenticating github from git
    authenticate to GitHub from the cli with the followoing command:
      -> $ gh auth login
      -> add the generated ssh key to the user settings
        -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH Key

git concepts:
  forks:
    -> A fork is a new repo that contains the code from the repo it was forked from and 
       builds on top of it
    -> it allows also for pull requests so someone who forked the repo can change the main 
       repos code

side notes:
  open source initiative:
    open source allows many different people to contribute to larger scale projects
    it forms communities around these projects
    open source can also be used for other things than code. (Datasets, legal documentation, etc.)
